Formal verification can feel like staring down a labyrinthespecially when its something as tricky as a memory or synchronous FIFO. All those states, all those combinations, all those ways for the tools to get lost in the weeds. Youd think its a problem begging for a stiff drink and a nap, not a solution. But heres a little elegance to cut through the chaos: the non-deterministic constant, or NDC for short. Its a free variable with a twistthink of it like an input the formal engines pin to one value per run, free to roam across all possibilities yet steady as a rock within each try. Picture it as an input told to sit still with an `assume($stable(input))`, but the engines can still pick any number they fancy. Its a neat trick, and its about to make our FIFO dance a lot more gracefully.

## The NDC, Unraveled

So whats an NDC, really? Its a wild card the formal tools deal youone value per game, but they shuffle the deck every round. The engines can play it anywhere, anytime, with any value, exploring every combo your design might face. Yet for a single run, its locked inno mid-game swaps. Thats the beauty well lean on to tame our FIFO beast. Lets see how it unfolds.

## FIFOs: The Verification Headache

Memories and FIFOs are the divas of formal verificationbig state spaces, endless value combos, and a knack for making tools sweat. But an NDC slips in like a clever stagehand, simplifying the show. First, lets set the scene with some modeling code to track the FIFOs fill level. Knowing how full it is at any tick lets us peek at the big signalsfull, empty, almost full, all the classics. Its like having a backstage pass to the FIFOs inner workings.

## The Main Act: Tracking a Word

Now, lets chase a single input word through the FIFO and confirm it pops out when it should. Say the fill levels at 2 when we drop a word inwed expect it to hit the output after two more reads, right? With the fill level in hand, we can latch it, start a countdown, and tick it down with each read. When that counter hits zero, bamour word should be staring us in the face at the FIFOs head. Simple, elegant, effective.

## The Catchand the NDC Fix

Heres the hitch: we cant track every word every cycle with a giant array of countdownsthats a fast track to a modeling meltdown. We need a starting gun, a signal to say go. Enter the NDC. We cook up some modeling code that grabs the fill level and kicks off the countdown the moment our NDC value shows up in the write data. The engines pick a value for the NDC, drop it into the FIFO at any fill level they please, and watch it ride through. For that run, we dont fuss over the other data sloshing aroundseparate runs handle the rest, like a series of one-act plays.

## Why It Works

It might take a second to click, but this is the full monty for FIFO verification. The NDCs freedom means the tools can inject it anywhere in the fill level, with any value, at any time. No constraints box it inweve left the when and where wide open. The engines churn through every input combo and FIFO state imaginable, run by run, ensuring our word-tracking logic holds up. Its not about watching every byte; its about proving the system sings no matter where the spotlight lands. Want to see it in action?

## The Takeaway: Less Chaos, More Clarity

Formal verification doesnt have to be a slog through FIFO quicksand. With an NDC, we sidestep the brute-force sprawl and zero in on what mattersdata flowing through, integration holding tight. Its a little bit of magic, a dash of cleverness, and a whole lot of why didnt I think of that sooner? Next time youre wrestling a memory monster, give the NDC a spin. Its the elegant shortcut you didnt know you needed.
